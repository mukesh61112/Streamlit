Understanding Indian Air Quality Index(AQI)

Air Pollution / By Nirvana

In an attempt to make air quality measurement easier to understand, the ministry of environment and forests launched a National Air Quality Index (AQI). It will put out real time data about level of pollutants in the air and inform people about possible impacts on health.

Government have added five more components to the new measurement process: Particulate Matter 2.5, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead

The index classifies air quality simply as good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor, and severe. Each band is represented by a colour code to visually express the level of severity that people can grasp easily.
